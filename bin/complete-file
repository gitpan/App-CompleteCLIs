=head1 NAME

complete-file - Complete file and directory from local filesystem

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.02 of complete-file (from Perl distribution App-CompleteCLIs), released on 2015-12-31.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % complete-file [options] <word>

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--ci>

Case-insensitive matching.

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--exp-im-path>

=item B<--filter-json>=I<s>

Only return items matching this filter (JSON-encoded).

See C<--filter>.

=item B<--filter>=I<s>

Only return items matching this filter.

Filter can either be a string or a code.

For string filter, you can specify a pipe-separated groups of sequences of these
characters: f, d, r, w, x. Dash can appear anywhere in the sequence to mean
not/negate. An example: `f` means to only show regular files, `-f` means only
show non-regular files, `drwx` means to show only directories which are
readable, writable, and executable (cd-able). `wf|wd` means writable regular
files or writable directories.

For code filter, you supply a coderef. The coderef will be called for each item
with these arguments: `$name`. It should return true if it wants the item to be
included.


=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display this help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--map-case>

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

=item B<--word>=I<s>*

Default value:

 ""

=back

=head1 FILES

B</etc/complete-file.conf>

B<~/complete-file.conf>

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C complete-file complete-file

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete complete-file 'p/*/`complete-file`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
