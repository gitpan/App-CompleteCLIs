=head1 NAME

complete-module - Complete with installed Perl module names

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.02 of complete-module (from Perl distribution App-CompleteCLIs), released on 2015-12-31.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % complete-module [options] <word>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each directory in C<@INC> (coderefs are ignored), find Perl modules and
module prefixes which have C<word> as prefix. So for example, given C<Te> as
C<word>, will return e.g. C<[Template, Template::, Term::, Test, Test::, Text::]>.
Given C<Text::> will return C<[Text::ASCIITable, Text::Abbrev, ...]> and so on.

This function has a bit of overlapping functionality with C<Module::List>, but
this function is geared towards shell tab completion. Compared to
C<Module::List>, here are some differences: 1) list modules where prefix is
incomplete; 2) interface slightly different; 3) (currently) doesn't do
recursing; 4) contains conveniences for completion, e.g. map casing, expand
intermediate paths (see C<Complete> for more details on those features),
autoselection of path separator character, some shortcuts, and so on.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=over

=item B<--ci>

Whether to do case-insensitive search.

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--exp-im-path>

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Choose output format, e.g. json, text.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Display this help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--map-case>

=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing. In this case you can use
`--naked-res` so you just get:

    [1,2,3]


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--no-find-pm>

=item B<--no-find-pmc>

=item B<--no-find-pod>

=item B<--no-find-prefix>

=item B<--ns-prefix>=I<s>

Namespace prefix.

This is useful if you want to complete module under a specific namespace
(instead of the root). For example, if you set `ns_prefix` to
`Dist::Zilla::Plugin` (or `Dist::Zilla::Plugin::`) and word is `F`, you can get
`['FakeRelease', 'FileFinder::', 'FinderCode']` (those are modules under the
`Dist::Zilla::Plugin::` namespace).


=item B<--version>, B<-v>

=item B<--word>=I<s>*

=back

=head1 FILES

B</etc/complete-module.conf>

B<~/complete-module.conf>

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C complete-module complete-module

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is recommended, however, that you install L<shcompgen> which allows you to activate completion scripts for several kinds of scripts on multiple shells. Some CPAN distributions (those that are built with L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenShellCompletion>) will even automatically enable shell completion for their included scripts (using C<shcompgen>) at installation time, so you can immadiately have tab completion.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete complete-module 'p/*/`complete-module`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

It is also recommended to install C<shcompgen> (see above).

=head2 other shells

For fish and zsh, install C<shcompgen> as described above.
